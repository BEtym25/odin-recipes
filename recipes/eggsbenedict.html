        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li> 
            
        <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li> 
            
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li> 
            
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li> 
            
        <li>8 eggs</li> 
            
        <li>8 slices rye bread</li> 
            
        <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into thin slices</li> 
            
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li> 
            
        <li>1 teaspoon capers, for garnish</li>             
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce: In the top of a double boiler, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, egg yolks, mustard, salt, sugar, pepper and hot sauce. Cook over simmering water while stirring constantly, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. </li>
        <li>In a large stock pot heat 2 quarts of salted water to a boil. Carefully break the eggs one at a time into the boiling water. When all the eggs have been added, reduce the heat to medium. When the eggs float to the top, remove them with a slotted spoon and let drain briefly.</li>
        <li>To assemble final dish: Toast bread slices and place on warm plates. Top each piece of toast with a slice of smoked salmon and a hot poached egg. Drizzle with yogurt sauce; garnish with parsley and capers.</li>
    </ol>
